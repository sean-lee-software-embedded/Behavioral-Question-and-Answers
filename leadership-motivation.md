# Leadership – Motivating a Teammate When Scope Ballooned

> **Question:** Describe a time when you were able to motivate unmotivated team members.

## Situation
A team member realized mid-sprint that the feature he owned was much larger than the original estimate. The requirements felt vague, the dependency list kept growing, and he didn’t want to proceed without a clear plan.

## Task
As the team lead, I had to remove the ambiguity by clarifying requirements, confirming the approach with stakeholders, and giving him a plan he could execute with confidence.

## Action
- Set up an alignment meeting with the stakeholder to walk through the requirement, refine open questions, and confirm the proposed solution so everyone agreed on scope and success criteria.
- Mapped the architecture end-to-end—server, client, framework/protocol library, and system pieces—and broke the work into clear tasks with owners and time slots so the engineer could see the sequence.

## Result
With a clarified requirement and a task breakdown, the engineer saw the big picture, committed to the plan, and scheduled each work item confidently.

**Interview Takeaway:** I motivate teammates by pairing clear stakeholder alignment with a detailed task plan so they can focus on delivery instead of second-guessing the scope.
