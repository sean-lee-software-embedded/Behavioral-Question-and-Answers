# Initiative – Building a Repeatable Certification Program

## Situation
When I took over Wi-Fi driver ownership for Barco’s ClickShare line, certification cycles with the Wi-Fi Alliance were unpredictable. Each device went through ad-hoc planning, labs were re-learning our requirements, and program managers were asking engineering to pad release schedules by months to absorb the risk.

## Task
As the engineering lead accountable for connectivity readiness, I needed to stabilize the certification timeline and remove the guesswork for both R&D and product management. We had to shorten the lead time and make the process scalable across the growing portfolio.

## Action
- Mapped the end-to-end certification workflow, interviewed every stakeholder (labs, QA, ODM, product) and documented the bottlenecks, especially handoffs that stalled on missing firmware builds or logs.
- Created a repeatable workload model with dependencies, staffing requirements, and decision checkpoints, then socialized it with program management so it became part of quarterly release planning.
- Automated the regression test bundles we sent to the labs, including golden configuration scripts, Wi-Fi 5/6E/7 profiles, and debug captures for common failure signatures.
- Extended the process beyond Wi-Fi by partnering with the HDMI/CEC and Bluetooth teams to reuse the templates, align on reporting, and consolidate vendor communications.

## Result
We cut the Wi-Fi certification lead time from roughly eight months to just three, eliminating release padding and improving predictability for product launches. The playbook became the model for other compliance domains, which raised my team’s profile with executive leadership.

**Interview Takeaway:** When I spot a recurring pain point, I translate the tribal knowledge into a scalable system so the entire organization moves faster with less risk.
